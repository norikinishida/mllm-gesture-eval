# Dataset Preparation

This directory contains preprocessing scripts for preparing the dataset used in our gesture explanation experiments.

## Steps

The dataset will be constructed through the following steps:

1. **Download the Miraikan SC Corpus**  
   Acquire the base corpus containing dialogue, gesture descriptions, and media data.

2. **Integrate gesture type annotations**  
   Merge gesture type labels with the corresponding gesture segments.

3. **Extract gesture instances**  
   Construct structured examples (JSON) containing:
   - Time spans
   - Dialogue utterances
   - Video frame sequences (paths)
   - Gesture type labels (e.g., Indexical, Iconic, Symbolic)
   - Reference gesture descriptions

ðŸ“¦ **Coming soon.**  
Detailed instructions and data format specifications will be added once the release is finalized.
