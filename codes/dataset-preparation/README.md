# Dataset Preparation

This directory contains preprocessing scripts for preparing the dataset used in our gesture explanation experiments.

ðŸ“¦ **Coming soon.**  
Miraikan SC Corpus, the dataset used in our paper, is currently undergoing ethical review and preparation for public release.  
We plan to make the dataset available upon completion of this process.

<!-- ## Steps

The dataset will be constructed through the following steps:

1. **Download the Miraikan SC Corpus**  
   Acquire the base corpus containing dialogue, gesture descriptions, and media data.

2. **Integrate gesture type annotations**  
   Merge gesture type labels with the corresponding gesture segments.

3. **Extract gesture instances**  
   Construct structured examples (JSON) containing:
   - Time spans
   - Dialogue utterances
   - Video frame sequences (paths)
   - Gesture type labels (e.g., Indexical, Iconic, Symbolic)
   - Reference gesture descriptions -->
