You are given a JSON object containing a list of Japanese utterances under the key "source".

Your task is to translate each utterance into natural and coherent English, preserving the conversational flow and the 1-to-1 alignment between input and output.

Return your result as a JSON object with a key "target", which is a list of translated English utterances.

Constraints:
- Maintain 1-to-1 correspondence: each Japanese utterance maps to one English utterance.
- Use natural, fluent spoken English (not too casual, not too formal).
- Translate deictic expressions (e.g., pointing, directions) carefully, as they relate to gestures in a video context.
- Do not add or remove utterances.

Input format example:
{{"source": ["scA: こっちこっち！", "v0: え？どこ？", "scA: あそこにあるじゃん、赤いやつ。"]}}

Expected output format:
{{"target": ["scA: Over here!", "v0: Huh? Where?", "scA: It's right there — the red one."]}}

Input utterances:
{input_utterances}

Output:
